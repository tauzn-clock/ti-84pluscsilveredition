This repo serves as an archive to my misadventures in assembly code.

Target Device: TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition

To compile the code:
1) Download the TASM Compiler [here](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/456/45654.html)
2) Move all assembly files under `./asm/source`
3) Compile with `./asm/compile.bat <filename>`


To use the code:
1) Download TI Connect CE from [here](https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/CA9C74CAD02440A69FDC7189D7E1B6C2/swticonnectcesoftware)
2) Download Doors CSE from [here](https://dcs.cemetech.net/index.php?title=Main_Page) and upload onto your calculator with TI Connect CE
3) Load each of the `.8xp` file into the calculator
4) Open them with Doors CSE (You can access Doors CSE vi the APPS button)
